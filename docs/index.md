# Github New User Onboarding Guide

Welcome to Intueor @ Github!

To get started, please follow these steps:

---

## Step 1. Create a Outlook Email Account

You’ll need a new Outlook email address for your Intueor Github account. We will not use our Intueor email since it can cause sign-on issues with Microsoft OneDrive. 

- Go to [Outlook.com](https://outlook.com)
- Click **Create free account**
- For your email address, we follow the convention of your first letters of first name, and last name followed by "intueor".
  - **For example:**  
    - If your name is "Jay Rider", your email should be `jrintueor@outlook.com`
    - In case , this username is already taken, you can add the next character of your first name (example jarintueor@outlook.com)
    - Similaryly you an append the next character of your last name if the email address is still not available. 
- Complete the signup process, set a strong password, and verify your email.

## Step 2. Create a GitHub Account

Now, use your new Outlook email to set up a GitHub account.

- Go to [GitHub Signup](https://github.com/join)
- Enter your new Outlook email address (e.g., `jrintueors@outlook.com`)
- In username, enter the first part (jrintueor) as in your new outlook email
- Enter password
- Complete the signup steps and
- Verify your email
