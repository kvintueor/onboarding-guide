# Intueor Githb New User Onboarding Guide

Welcome to Intueor!

To get started, please follow these steps:

---

## Step 1. Create a Free Outlook Email Account

You’ll need a new Outlook email address for your Intueor Github account.

- Go to [Outlook.com](https://outlook.com)
- Click **Create free account**
- For your email address, use your Intueor username.
  - **For example:**  
    - If your name is Chris, your email should be `crodes@outlook.com`
    - Replace "crodes" with your own Intueor username (ask your manager if unsure)
- Complete the signup process, set a strong password, and verify your email.

---

## Step 2. Create a GitHub Account

Now, use your new Outlook email to set up a GitHub account.

- Go to [GitHub Signup](https://github.com/join)
- Enter your new Outlook email address (e.g., `crodes@outlook.com`)
- Choose a username and password (your GitHub username does not have to be the same as your Intueor username)
- Complete the signup steps and verify your email
